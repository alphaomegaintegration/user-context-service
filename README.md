# Solution Design Document


## Problem Statement

Develop a Spring Boot API with Spring Batch capabilities to manage user entities, user context entities, context entities, and role entities. Implement a Spring Batch process to load users from a CSV file into Redis and an Identity Provider.

## Proposed Solution

1. API Development
   Key Components:

Spring Boot: Framework for building web applications with embedded Tomcat server.
Spring Data JPA: Manages persistence for entities using a relational database.
Spring Web: Provides RESTful API development features.
Redis: In-memory data store for caching user data.
Identity Provider: External system for authentication and authorization.
API Endpoints:

CRUD operations for UserEntity, UserContextEntity, ContextEntity, and RoleEntity.
Endpoint to trigger the Spring Batch job for user loading.
Endpoint to monitor job status and retrieve logs.
Authentication and Authorization:

Integrate with the Identity Provider for user authentication and access control.
2. Spring Batch Process
   Job Configuration:

Define a Spring Batch job with a single step:
CSV ItemReader: Reads user data from a CSV file.
UserLoad ItemProcessor: Processes UserLoad objects (validation, mapping, password security).
UserEntity ItemWriter: Writes UserEntity objects to Redis and the Identity Provider.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling with logging and potential retry mechanisms.
Transactionality:

Ensure consistency across Redis and Identity Provider updates using Spring Batch's transaction management.
Security:

Protect sensitive data (passwords) during processing and transmission.
Configuration:

Externalize configuration for job parameters, data sources, and credentials.
Monitoring and Logging:

Integrate with Spring Batch Admin for job monitoring and logging.
## Additional Considerations

Testing: Implement thorough unit and integration tests to ensure API and batch process reliability.
Deployment: Package the application for deployment to a suitable environment (e.g., containerization).
Maintenance: Plan for ongoing maintenance, updates, and monitoring.
Scalability: Consider scalability requirements for high-volume user data.
Performance: Optimize performance for efficient user data management and retrieval.

# user-context-service
Service to manage users

1. Define reusable security model to use across challenges
   a. Context 
   b. UserContext
2. Define process for loading security pricinpals into persistence store


```shell
http GET https://randomuser.me/api results==20 noinfo==true nat==us format==csv inc==name,email,location  > src/test/resources/test-users-1.csv

```
