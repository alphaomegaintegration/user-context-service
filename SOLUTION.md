# Solution Design Document

## Problem Statement

How do we create an API for managing domain specific roles and 
permissions to be used across various 'contexts'. These contexts 
could represent a domain covered by a microservice. 

- Develop a Spring Boot and Spring Batch-based API for managing users, contexts, roles, and security.
- Integrate with Redis for persistent storage and an external Identity Provider (IDP).
- Implement core features:
    1. Load users from CSV files into Redis and IDP.
    2. Load users from JSON files into Redis and IDP.
    3. Provide token brokering via REST endpoints (Simulate Basic Auth)
    4. Provide token validation and claim discovery via REST endpoints
    5. Offer REST endpoints for managing contexts, users, usercontexts.
    6. Offer fine grained security model for domain
    7. Integrate with apps using Spring Security.

## Architecture Overview

**Components:**

- **Spring Boot Application:** Foundation for the API.
- **Spring Batch:** Framework for batch processing user loading.
- **Redis:** In-memory data store for persistent user data.
- **Identity Provider:** External system for authentication and authorization.
- **REST API:** Endpoints for managing security models and integration.
- **Spring Security:** Framework for securing the API and endpoints.

## High-Level Design

1. **REST API:**
    - Manage user entities, context entities, and role entities.
    - Provide endpoints for managing security models.
    - Integrate with apps using Spring Security.
2. **Spring Batch:**
    - Load users from CSV and JSON files.
    - Process and validate user data.
    - Persist users to Redis.
    - Push users to the Identity Provider.
3. **Security:**
    - Implement a consistent security model using Spring Security.
    - Protect sensitive data and operations.
    - Enforce authorization rules.

## Detailed Design

**Data Persistence:**

- Use Redis for caching and fast retrieval of user data.
- Persist user entities, context entities, and role entities.

**Spring Batch Jobs:**

- Define separate jobs for CSV and JSON loading.
- Implement `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter` components.
- Handle errors and retries.
- Ensure transactional consistency across Redis and IDP updates.

**Security Model:**

- Define roles and permissions.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Secure REST endpoints using Spring Security.
- Integrate with Spring Security-based apps.

**REST Endpoints:**

- Provide CRUD operations for security entities.
- Enable management of users, contexts, and roles.
- Allow integration with external apps.

**## Technologies**

- Spring Boot
- Spring Batch
- Spring Data Redis
- Spring Security
- Identity Provider SDK (specific to the chosen IDP)
- JSON parsing library (e.g., Jackson)

## Implementation Considerations

- Thorough testing, including performance and security testing.
- Error handling and logging.
- Monitoring and alerting.
- Scalability considerations for future growth.

## Additional Considerations

- **Deployment:** Plan for deployment to a suitable environment.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and alerting for job status and errors.
- **Maintenance:** Establish a maintenance plan for updates and bug fixes.
